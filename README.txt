Project Title: Robotics Lab Equipment Booking System

Author: 
Date: October 15 2023

## Description

Currently, the process for booking equipment in the robotics lab has three issues:
1. The process requires direct communication with students to staff, which introduces human error
2. The lab technician must manually input information which is quite tedious
3. In the case where equipment goes missing or is broken, there is no concrete process for recording the issue.

The purpose of the project was to create an automated booking system to streamline the process of booking equipment in the University robotics lab.
It provdes easy remote access to detailed information about available equipment and provide an organised system for recording equipment incidents.
